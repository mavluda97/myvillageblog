    	<p>Today, in my village, 9 cute chickens were born. They are very small and very beatiful.I was very happy because of seeing such a beauty. I think that this kind of small miracles or beauties are enough to the people to be happy in this world. If you have chance to see the sunset, try to be happy every moment of this beauty. Sometimes, people have no time for such events. So that, I tried to express my happiness in my blog...<br> Please, be happy every moment of your life. Try to make your family, friends happy. Because such kind of chances cannot be repeated in your life... So, be happy... </p>
